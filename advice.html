 <h3 class="PH"><b><u>Advice for YOU</b></u></h3>

 <h3 class="EDM">Advice in mental health will help you, or just be words spoken to you depending <br>
 on your mindset. If you want to improve your mental health, and need help from other people, then you 
 have to let the advice help, instead of pushing it away. Many people go to therapy, or just simply have 
 a talk with someone they trust, or some people write down their thoughts or feelings in a journal that 
 they keep to themselves. These methods work, or maybe you need to do all of them to feel better. 
 Having your mental state in a good place will make your on-going life much easier. Not all advice will be 
 criticism, some advice will just be people talking from experience. Learning how to except things from other 
 people will turn out to be a good thing. Over time, when you start listening to the advice you are given,
 you will be able to face struggles on your own without talking or begging someone to listen to you because 
 you already have been conditioned to know how to do it yourself. There will always be difficult obstacles you are 
 going to have to face by yourself, and they might tear you down, or make you feel lost, but those times will 
 just prepare you for the next time, if there even is a next time. </h3>
