 <h3 class="PH"><b><u>Exercises</b></u></h3>

 <h3 class="EDM">There are several kinds of exercises you can do, and not all of them involve lifting weights. <br>
 Of course there is weight lifting, which can help grow the muscles, like the biceps, but you do not have to stick to
 the equipment in the gym. You can go for runs, or walks, and those are both great ways to get in shape. If you want to 
 have a plan, then you can. Exercises are supposed to keep your body healthy for itself, and all bodies will adjust differently
 and take time. So there is no need to worry if someone else gets what they want faster, or see results easier. Exercising is supposed
 to make YOU feel GOOD!
