 The most important things your body needs is a source of: carbs, protein, fat, fiber, vitamins,<br>
 minerals and water. All though there are MANY different kinds of diets, you get to choose which one <br>
 would help you the most. Diets aren't always about loosing weight, they help you get the right amount of <br>
 foods you need. Take a look at some, and choose what YOU feel your body needs, or just to try something new. </h3>

			</h2>
			<p>
<h3 class="M">Motivation. Like getting a reward after you win something. Keeping up with your body physically can be much easier <br>
 if you have something to work for. Example, you can treat yourself to a spa, or a free day, or even a sweet snack. <br>
 If you have something to look forwards to, you probably will want to do whatever you can to do it. <br>
 You also can have motivation that isn't tangible. You can have a mindset that keeping your body physically healthy <br> 
 will have a postive effect on your life. Motivation is all about having energy to keep up with yourself.</h3> 			</p>
